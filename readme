Requires Youtube DL which requires FFMpeg. 
colors.txt is required for the graphic. I found that I couldn't hard code it into the batch script without issues so just get the ascii art from the file. 
I believe it needs to be in the same folder as the script. 
I just put the script in my youtube dl folder and it just works.

Files are stored in a Folder called BOOTY in the same directory as the script.
